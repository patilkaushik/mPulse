# mPulse
This shell script is designed to capture system runtime diagnostic data for better investigation and troubleshooting performance as well as impairments

Something about the script
        - Original intention of the script was to reduce manual efforts and specifically written/hardcoded for centOS hence might not work on other linux flavors
        - This script captures System logs, System runtime, System information and recently added JVM diagnostics
        - This is script is still under developement
