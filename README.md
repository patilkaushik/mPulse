# mPulse
This shell script is designed to capture system runtime diagnostic data for investigating and troubleshooting the performance issues as well as Production impairments.

Something about the script
        - The intention of this script is to reduce the manual efforts to minimize the impairment durations and mitigate the potential risk of human errors. 
	- The shell script was written assuming that it will be used only for centOS. Hence might not work on other linux flavors. Some minor tweaks can do the trick. Source is open help yourself :)
        - This script captures System logs, System runtime, System information and recently added JVM diagnostics
        - This is script is WIP
